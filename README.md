This example demonstrates a common JavaScript pitfall: implicit type coercion leading to unexpected string concatenation.  The function `foo` intends to add two numbers, but due to JavaScript's dynamic typing, when a number and a string are used as arguments, the `+` operator performs string concatenation rather than numerical addition. The solution shows how to explicitly type check or use the `parseInt()` function to ensure numerical addition.
